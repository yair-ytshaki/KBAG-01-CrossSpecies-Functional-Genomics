# KBAG-01-CrossSpecies-Functional-Genomics
Project Objective: To develop an integrated computational pipeline that correlates Mouse Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) variants with human genetic counterparts. The system leverages AI foundation models and spatial/pathological AI to bridge the gap between mouse discovery and human clinical relevance
